Implementing date-time:
    * Add date field for front end - for now use date input (unusupported on some browsers), extend later
    * Add date field to database - store as date
    * Add crud actions to read back from database and sort by date field (ascending and descending)
    * Each workout should store date as a Date object so comparisons between dates can be made
