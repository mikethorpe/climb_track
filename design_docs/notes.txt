        dropdowns are populated as previously selected by the user
    * Workout result icons with +/- or number symbols
    * Seed the exercises with beast maker workouts
    * Write a help section
    * Consider the original wireframe - do we want to match this? - regardless, 
        update the wireframe so that it matches implementation after 
        decision made
    * Consider not allowing the user to update an exercise once it has been
        associated with a workout
    * Update design docs to ensure they agree with the code
    * Add some unit tests
    * Pin down some acceptance criteria that describe the behaviour
    * CSS styling & formatting in HTML - think about the UX
    * Review code and improve quality
    * Take photos of paper design docs and add to repo

Help section:
    * Give links to the beast maker / training websites to get started. 
    * Indicate that there are some pre seeded exercises and their source.
    * Indicate what the training result icons mean
    * Describe the workflow and give examples
    * Tell user why they can't delete certain exercises due to workout association
    * Tell user that workouts can lapse
    * Tell user that once they save the result of a workout they can't change it
    * Tell user that updating an exercise will cause it to be updated for all
        workouts that it has been associated with past and present

The near future:
    * Build in user authentication
